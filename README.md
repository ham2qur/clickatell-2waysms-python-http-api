# clickatell-2waysms-python-http-api
A python library for sending and receiving SMS through Clickatell's 2 Way SMS HTTP API using HTTP POST

Right now, responders and users are pseudoanonymous after users send the initial message

##To-Do:
* Write the proxy conversation between a user and subscriber
* Add a blocking option "If you beleive this is in error then please contact the administrators." auto-response
* Write this as a daemon
* Test the library on a server and see if it works (I'm flying blind at the moment)
* Write an actual readme with documentation about how this works
